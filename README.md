**Abstract:**   
Pancreatic islets of Langerhans produce bursts of electrical activity when
exposed to stimulatory glucose levels. These bursts often have a regular
repeating pattern, with a period of 10-60 s. In some cases, however, the
bursts are episodic, clustered into bursts of bursts, which we call compound
bursting. Consistent with this are recordings of free Ca2+ concentration,
oxygen consumption, mitochondrial membrane potential, and intraislet glucose
levels that exhibit very slow oscillations, with faster oscillations
superimposed. We describe a new mathematical model of the pancreatic beta-cell
that can account for these multimodal patterns. The model includes the
feedback of cytosolic Ca2+ onto ion channels that can account for bursting,
and a metabolic subsystem that is capable of producing slow oscillations
driven by oscillations in glycolysis. This slow rhythm is responsible for the
slow mode of compound bursting in the model. We also show that it is possible
for glycolytic oscillations alone to drive a very slow form of bursting, which
we call "glycolytic bursting." Finally, the model predicts that there is
bistability between stationary and oscillatory glycolysis for a range of
parameter values. We provide experimental support for this model prediction.
Overall, the model can account for a diversity of islet behaviors described in
the literature over the past 20 years.
